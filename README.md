# Libft
My Libft project in C, where I recode some functions, improving it whenever I have new needs. I'm trying to keep it up to date.

The actual version of this tool is **version 0.2.0**

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this git locally, then start compiling by typing these commands :
```
make
```
And then
```
make clean
```

You should now be ready to go with a libft.a available

## Versioning

I am based on [SemVer](http://semver.org/) norms for versioning.
